* fix Rails 3 compatibility issue (RAILS_ROOT usage)

0.1.0

* hopefully fixed the collisions that were occuring if more than one class used
  acts_as_lookup at the same time.

0.0.2
----
* adding in the has_lookup method for Rails models to associate to lookup models
* more FUTURE comments added, as well as TODO file additions
* slight cleanups
* when creating shortcut methods, now follow these rules:
** convert spaces in shortcut column to underscores
** don't downcase all-caps shortcut names
** otherwise, downcase everything
** detect method name conflicts

----
* first implementation of the gem, makes lots of assumptions
